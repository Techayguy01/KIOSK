Design a hotel kiosk UI using the following principles:

* Touch-first interface with minimum 60px targets
* No scrolling unless absolutely necessary
* Max 4–6 actions per screen
* Wizard-style guided flow; one clear action per step
* High-contrast, large typography readable at 1 meter
* Multi-language support
* No hover interactions; all tap/click
* No excessive decoration, ads, or non-essential content
* Error-proof inputs: dropdowns/selectors instead of typing
* Clear back/next buttons on every step
* Auto-reset session after inactivity
* Never persist PII locally
* Layout must be simple, friendly, and stress-free
* All components must be reusable, scalable, and consistent
* UI must align with WCAG AA standards
